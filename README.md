# attendance_members_flemish_parliament
This repository holds code to set up a Dash application to dynamically assess the attendance of members of parliament of the Flemisch parliament.
It uses the data as available on the website of the Flemish Parliament (https://www.vlaamsparlement.be) as well as through the dedicated API (http://ws.vlpar.be/e/opendata/api).
